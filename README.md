# FindFace
A python facial recognition software. Capable of detect faces and eyes. Utilizes OpenCV to process images and OpenCV Casscade Classifiers to classify human eyes and faces.

To run this software, all you need to do is run the [main.py](/main.py) file. It's that simple. It will open up your default connected camera device, and draw rectangles over any eyes or faces in frame.
